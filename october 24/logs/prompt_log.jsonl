Imagine teaching a child to recognize cats: you show them many pictures of cats and tell them when they\u2019ve gotten it right or wrong. Over time, the child gets better at identifying cats. Similarly, a machine learning model is trained by feeding it lots of data (like pictures) and feedback (like correct answers). The model finds patterns in the data and uses those patterns to make predictions or decisions, such as recognizing new pictures of cats. There are three main types:\n\n- **Supervised learning**: The model is trained with labeled data (e.g., pictures labeled \"cat\" or \"not cat\").\n- **Unsupervised learning**: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., grouping similar pictures without knowing what they are).\n- **Reinforcement learning**: The model learns by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions (like a robot learning to navigate a maze)."}

It involves creating computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and understanding language. AI can be simple, like a chatbot, or complex, like a self-driving car. Basically, it's about making machines smarter so they can help with tasks in a more human-like way.", "quiz": " Hereâ€™s a short quiz for a beginner about artificial intelligence (AI):\n\n1.
